## General

Garden Linux supports integration testing on all major cloud platforms (Alicloud, AWS, Azur, GCP). To allow testing even without access to any cloud platform we created an universal `kvm` platform that may run locally and is accessed in the same way via a `ssh client object` as any other cloud platform. Therefore, you do not need to adjust tests to perform local integration tests. All platforms are described in detail below. Beside this, you may also find additional tests that may be used for developing and contributing to fit the Garden Linux style guides.

## Chart
This chart briefly describes the process of unit-, platform/integration tests.

```

## Unit Tests

**Corner case**: When it comes to unit testing these tests will be executed in a context of integration tests. This means that a specific platform type (`chroot`) of integration tests is used to perform regular `unit tests`. This is due to the fact that we want to achive a common test platform based on `Pytest` and theses ones should still be executable on any platform without further adjustments. However, these tests are still located in a subfolder (`test`) within the features directory and must be prefixed with `test_`. This means, that any feature may provide a subfolder called `test` including their `unit test(s)`. `Pytest` will automaticly include these files and validate if they need to run (e.g. `cis` tests will only run if the given artifact was built with this feature).

**Location of Unit Tests:**

`features/$FEATUR_NAME/test/test_$TEST_NAME.py`

**Example:**

| Feature | Unit test | Test location |
|---|---|---|
| $FEATURE_NAME | test_$TEST_NAME.py | features/$FEATUR_NAME/test/test_$TEST_NAME.py |
| CIS | test_cis.py | [features/cis/test/test_cis.py](../features/cis/test/test_cis.py) |


## Prerequisites

Build the integration test container with all necessary dependencies. This container image will contain all necessary Python modules as well as the command line utilities by the Cloud providers (i.e. AWS, Azure and GCP). *Note: For `KVM` and `CHROOT` platforms the auto created `gardenlinux/base-test` container can be used (as documented) but will also work with the fullfleged testing container `gardenlinux/integration-test`.*

    make --directory=container build-integration-test

The resulting container image will be tagged as `gardenlinux/integration-test:<version>` with `<version>` being the version that is returned by `bin/garden-version` in this repository. All fruther tests run inside this container.

## Using the tests on supported platforms

### General

The integration tests require a config file containing vital information for interacting with the cloud providers. In the following sections, the configuration options are described in general and for each cloud provider individually.

Since the configuration options are provided as a structured YAML with the cloud provider name as root elements, it is possible to have everything in just one file.

### Public cloud platforms

These tests test Garden Linux on public cloud providers like Amazons AWS, Googles Cloud Platforms, Microsofts Azure or Aliyuns Allibaba Cloud. You need a valid subscription in these hyperscalers to run the tests.

#### AWS

Notes for AWS credentials:
- credentials must be supplied by having them ready in `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`
  - The `aws configure` command can be used to create these files.
- `~/.aws` gets mounted into the container that executes the integration tests
- While using MFA, a dedicated MFA session must be created.
  - This can be achieved by executing the following command (requires login)
    ```
    aws sts get-session-token --serial-number <MFA Device ID> --token-code <Token>
    ```
  - The returned `AccessKeyID`, `SecretAccessKey` and `SessionToken` must be stored in the `~/.aws/credentials` file.
  - It is useful to use a dedicated profile for the MFA session, which could look like this:
    ```
    [mfa]
    aws_access_key_id = <Access Key ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <Secret Access Key>
    aws_session_token = <Session Token>
    region = <Region>
    ```
  - In order to let pytest use the correct profile, it must be assigned via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable during execution.

Use the following configuration file:

```yaml
aws:
    # region in which all test resources will be created (required)
    region: eu-central-1
    # machine/instance type of the test VM - not all machines are available in all regions (optional)
    instance_type: t3.micro
    # architecture of the image and VM to be used (optional)
    architecture: x86_64

    # ssh related configuration for logging in to the VM (optional)
    ssh:
        # path to the ssh key file (optional)
        ssh_key_filepath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa_gardenlinux_test
        # passphrase for a secured SSH key (optional)
        passphrase:
        # name of the public ssh key object as it gets imported into EC2 (optional)
        key_name: gardenlinux-test-2
        # username used to connect to the EC2 instance (optional, must be admin on AWS)
        user: admin

    # if specified this already existing AMI will be used and no image uploaded (optional/alternatively required)
    #ami_id: ami-xxx
    # local/S3 image file to be uploaded for the test (optional/alternatively required)
    image: file:/build/aws/20210714/amd64/bullseye/rootfs.raw
    #image: s3://gardenlinux/objects/078f440a76024ccd1679481708ebfc32f5431569
    # bucket where the image will be uploded to (optional)
    bucket: import-to-ec2-gardenlinux-validation

    # keep instance running after tests finishes (optional)
    keep_running: false
```

Run the tests (be sure you properly mounted the Garden Linux repository to the container and you are in `/gardenlinux/tests`):

    pytest --iaas=gcp --configfile=/config/mygcpconfig.yaml


### Local test environments

These tests flavours will make use of chroot, KVM virtual machines or OpenStack environments and thus can be used locally without a paid subscription to a public cloud provider.

#### CHROOT

CHROOT tests are designed to run directly on your platform within a `chroot` environment and boosts up the time for the integration tests that do not need any target platform.

Notes:
 * CHROOT will run inside your `integration-test` Docker container
 * Podman container needs `SYS_ADMIN`, `MKNOD`, `AUDIT_WRITE` and `NET_RAW` capability
 * Temporary SSH keys are auto generated and injected

Use the following configuration file to proceed; only the path to the TAR image needs to be adjusted:

```yaml
chroot:
    # Path to a final artifact. Represents the .tar.xz archive image file (required)
    image: /gardenlinux/.build/kvm_dev-amd64-dev-local.tar.xz

    # IP or hostname of target machine (required)
    # Default: 127.0.0.1
    ip: 127.0.0.1

    # port for remote connection (required)
    # Default: 2223
    port: 2222

    # list of features that is used to determine the tests to run
    features:
      - "base"

    # SSH configuration (required)
    ssh:
        # Defines path where to look for a given key
        # or to save the new generated one. Take care
        # that you do NOT overwrite your key. (required)
        ssh_key_filepath: /tmp/ssh_priv_key

        # Defines the user for SSH login (required)
        # Default: root
        user: root
```

##### Configuration options

<details>

- **features** _(optional)_: If not set, the feature tests will be skipped, if set it must contain a list of features. The tests defined in the listed features will be used. The features used to build the image can be found in the _image\_name_.os-release file in the output directory.
- **ssh_key_filepath** _(required)_: The SSH key that will be injected to the *chroot* and that will be used by the test framework to log on to it. In default, you do **not** need to provide or mount your real SSH key; a new one will be generated and injected by every new run. However, if you really want, a present one can be defined - take care that this will not be overwritten and set `ssh_key_generate` to false.
- **user** _(required)_: The user that will be used for the connection.
</details>

##### Running the tests

Start Podman container with dependencies:

- mount Garden Linux repository to `/gardenlinux`
- mount build result directory to `/build` (if not part of the Garden Linux file tree)
- mount directory with configfile to `/config`
- NOTE: The testing SSHd expects the regular `authorized_keys` file to be named as `test_authorized_keys`

```
sudo podman run --cap-add SYS_ADMIN,MKNOD,AUDIT_WRITE,NET_RAW --security-opt apparmor=unconfined -it --rm -v `pwd`:/gardenlinux gardenlinux/base-test:`bin/garden-version` /bin/bash
```

Run the tests (be sure you properly mounted the Garden Linux repository to the container and you are in `/gardenlinux/tests`):

    pytest --iaas=chroot --configfile=/config/mychrootconfig.yaml


#### KVM

KVM tests are designed to run directly on your platform. Currently, AMD64 and ARM64 architectures are supported.
Notes:
 * KVM/QEMU will run inside your `integration-test` Docker container
 * (Default) New temporary SSH keys are auto generated and injected
 * (Default: amd64) AMD64 and ARM64 architecutres are supported

Use the following configuration file to proceed; only the path to the image needs to be adjusted:

```yaml
kvm:
    # Path to a final artifact. Represents the .raw image file (required)
    image: /gardenlinux/.build/kvm_dev-amd64-dev-local.raw

    # IP or hostname of target machine (optional)
    # Default: 127.0.0.1
    #ip: 127.0.0.1

    # port for remote connection (required)
    # Default: 2223
    port: 2223

    # Keep machine running after performing tests
    # for further debugging (optional)
    # Default: false
    #keep_running: false

    # list of features that is used to determine the tests to run
    features:
      - "base"

    # Architecture to boot including its
    # hardware accelerator (optional)
    # Default: amd64
    #arch: arm64
    #accel: kvm		# [kvm,hvf,none]


    # SSH configuration (required)
    ssh:
        # Defines if a new SSH key should be generated (optional)
        # Default: true
        ssh_key_generate: true

        # Defines path where to look for a given key
        # or to save the new generated one. Take care
        # that you do NOT overwrite your key. (required)
        ssh_key_filepath: /tmp/ssh_priv_key

        # Defines if a passphrase for a given key is needed (optional)
        #passphrase: xxyyzz

        # Defines the user for SSH login (required)
        # Default: root
        user: root
```

In default, you do **not** need to provide or mount your real SSH key; a new one will be generated and injected by every new run. However, if you really want, a present one can be defined - take care that this will not be overwritten and set `ssh_key_generate` to false.
- **passphrase** _(optional)_: If the given SSH key is protected with a passphrase, it needs to be provided here.
- **user** _(required)_: The user that will be used for the connection.
- **keep_running** _(optional)_: If set to `true`, all tests resources, especially the VM will not get removed after the test (independent of the test result) to allow further debugging. Default: `False`.

</details>

##### Running the tests

Start Podman container with dependencies:

- mount Garden Linux repository to `/gardenlinux`
- mount /boot and /lib/modules for guestfish support (required for KVM tools)
- mount build result directory to `/build` (if not part of the Garden Linux file tree)
- mount directory with configfile to `/config`
- mount SSH keys that are used to log in to the virtual machine to `/root/.ssh` (Optional: only needed when no SSH keys should be autogenerated)
- KVM: For `KVM` accel we need to run `Podman` with `--device=/dev/kvm` option
- NOTE: The testing SSHd expects the regular `authorized_keys` file to be named as `test_authorized_keys`

**With SSH autogeneration**
This is the default and recommended way.
```
sudo podman run -it --rm --device=/dev/kvm -v /boot/:/boot -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules -v `pwd`:/gardenlinux gardenlinux/base-test:`bin/garden-version` /bin/bash
```

**Without SSH autogeneration**
Use this only when really needed.
```
sudo podman run -it --rm --device=/dev/kvm -v `pwd`:/gardenlinux -v /boot/:/boot -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules -v `pwd`/.build/:/build -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v ~/config:/config gardenlinux/base-test:`bin/garden-version` /bin/bash
```

Run the tests (be sure you properly mounted the Garden Linux repository to the container and you are in `/gardenlinux/tests`):

    pytest --iaas=kvm --configfile=/config/mykvmconfig.yaml


#### Manual Testing

So for some reason, you do not want to test Garden Linux by using a tool that automatically sets up the testbed in a cloud environment for you.

You rather want to set up a host running Garden Linux yourself, create a user in it, somehow slip in an SSH public key and have a hostname/ip-address you can use to connect. Now all you want is to have the tests run on that host. This section about _Manual testing_ is for you then.

Use the following (very simple) test configuration:

```yaml
manual:
    # mandatory, the hostname/ip-address of the host the tests should run on
    host:

    # ssh related configuration for logging in to the VM (required)
    ssh:
        # path to the ssh private key file (required)
        ssh_key_filepath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa_gardenlinux_test
        # passphrase for a secured SSH key (optional)
        passphrase:
        # username
        user: admin
```

##### Running the tests

Start Podman container with dependencies:

- mount Garden Linux repository to `/gardenlinux`
- mount SSH keys to `/root/.ssh`
- mount directory with configfile to `/config`

```
sudo podman run -it --rm  -v `pwd`:/gardenlinux -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v ~/config:/config  gardenlinux/integration-test:`bin/garden-version` bash
```

Run the tests (be sure you properly mounted the Garden Linux repository to the container and you are in `/gardenlinux/tests`):

    pytest --iaas=manual --configfile=/config/myconfig.yaml


#### OpenStack CC EE flavor

Obtain credentials by downloading an OpenStack RC file and source it after adding your password to it. Alternatively you could statically add the password to it (environment variable `OS_PASSWORD`) and specifcy that file in the configuration.

**Note** that the test will not attempt to create networks, security groups, or attached floating IPs to the virtual machines. The security group and network must exist and most likely the test will have to be executed from a machine in the same network.

Use the following test configuration:

```yaml
openstack_ccee:
    # the OpenStack RC filename
    credentials:

    # if an image id is provided the test will not attempt
    # to upload an image
    # image_id: e3685bf1-2b6d-4291-86af-d4a73d54c6bd

    # image file (a vmdk)
    image: <image-file.vmdk>

    # image name is optional, if not provided a name will be chosen
    image_name: integration-test

    # OpenStack flavor (`openstack flavor list`)
    flavor: g_c1_m2

    # security group (must exist)
    security_group: gardenlinux-sg

    # network name (must exist)
    network_name: gardenlinux

    # ssh related configuration for logging in to the VM (required)
    ssh:
        # path to the ssh key file (required)
        ssh_key_filepath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa_gardenlinux_test
        # key name in OpenStack
        key_name: gardenlinux_integration_test
        # passphrase for a secured SSH key (optional)
        passphrase:
        # username used to connect to the Azure instance (required)
        user: gardenlinux

    # keep instance running after tests finishes (optional)
    keep_running: false
```

##### Configuration options

<details>

- **credentials** _(optional)_: the openstack rc file downloaded from the UI with the password added. If unset the test runtime will read the values from the environment

- **image_name** _(optional)_: the image name for the uploaded image. If unset a generic name will be used.
- **image_id** _(optional)_: if specified the tests will use an existing image for the test. No image will be uploaded
- **image** _(optional/required)_: if no **image_id** is specified this must reference the image `vmdk` file.
- **flavor** _(required)_: an existing flavor name (installation specific)
- **security_group** _(required)_: the security group name for the virtual machine
- **network_name** _(required)_: the network name for the virtual machine
- **ssh_key_filepath** _(required)_: The SSH key that will be deployed to the GCE instance and that will be used by the test framework to log on to it. Must be the file containing the private part of an SSH keypair which needs to be generated with `openssh-keygen` beforehand.
- **passphrase** _(optional)_: If the given SSH key is protected with a passphrase, it needs to be provided here.
- **user** _(required)_: The user that will be provisioned to the GCE instance, which the SSH key gets assigned to and that is used by the test framework to log on the Azure instance.

- **keep_running** _(optional)_: if set to `true`, all tests resources, especially the VM will not get removed after the test (independent of the test result) to allow for debugging

## Misc
Within this section further tests are listed that may help developing and contributing on Garden Linux. These tests are disjunct from the Garden Linux code itself and may only perform validation on code (like `Shellcheck` or `autopep`).

### Autoformat Using Black

in order to auto format the source code run

    pipenv run black .

### Run Static Checks

    pipenv run flake8 .

### Shellcheck
Shellcheck is a static analysis tool and allows to analyse and validate given scripts. Tests must be executed explicitly via `pytest shellcheck`. This tool is disjunct from Garden Linux itself and can run on any files within the test container. For more details see Shellcheck [shellcheck/README.md](shellcheck/README.md).

    pytest shellcheck --severity=error
