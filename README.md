# Gardenlinux
<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/main/logo/gardenlinux-logo-black-text.svg"> <a href="https://gardenlinux.io/">Garden Linux</a> is a <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> derivate that aims to provide small, auditable linux images for most Cloud Providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP etc.) and Bare Metal. Garden Linux is the best Linux for <a href="https://gardener.cloud/">Gardener</a> nodes. Garden Linux provides great possibilities for customizing and provides a great feature set to fit your needs. <br><br>

- Supporting major platforms out-of-the-box
  - Major cloud providers AWS, Azure, Google, Alicloud
  - Major virtualizer VMware, OpenStack, KVM
  - Bare Metal

## Quick Start
The entire build runs in a <i>privileged</i> Docker container that orchestrates all further actions. If not explicitly skipped, unit tests will be performed. Extended capabilities are at least needed for loop back support. Currently AMD64 and ARM64 architectures are supported.

### Build Requirements

**System:**
* RAM: 2+ GiB (use '--lessram' to lower memory usage)
* Disk: 10+ GiB
* Internet connection

**Packages:**

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```
apt install bash docker.io docker-compose make coreutils gnupg git qemu-system-x86 qemu-system-aarch64
```

**CentOS/RedHat (>=8):**

CFSSL requires `GLIBC 2.28`. Therefore, we recommand to build on systems running CentOS/RedHat 8 or later.

```
# Please use Docker repository for CentOS/RedHat:
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/
yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Install Docker compose
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/2.3.3/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
-o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Install needed packages
yum install bash make gnupg git qemu-kvm qemu-img
```

**Kernel Modules:**
* ext4
* loop
* squashfs
* vfat
* vsock <i><small>(image builds and extended virtualized tests)</i></small>

### Build Options
| Option | Description  |
|---|---|
| --features  | Comma separated list of features activated (see features/) (default:base) |
| --disable-features | Comma separated list of features to deactivate (see features/) |
| --lessram | Build will be no longer in memory (default: off) |
| --debug | Activates basically \`set -x\` everywhere (default: off) |
| --manual | Built will stop in build environment and activate manual mode (debugging) (default:off) |
| --arch | Builds for a specific architecture (default: architecture the build runs on) |
| --suite | Specifies the debian suite to build for e.g. bullseye, potatoe (default: testing) |
| --skip-tests | Deactivating tests (default: off) |
| --skip-build | Do not create the build container BUILD_IMAGE variable would specify an alternative name |

### Building

To build all supported images you may just run the following command:
```
    make all
```

However, to safe time you may also build just a platform specific image by running one of the following commands. Related dev images can be created by appending the '-dev' suffix (e.g. "make aws-dev").
```
    make aws
    make gcp
    make azure
    make ali
    make vmware
    make openstack
    make kvm
    make metal
```

Artifacts are located in the `.build/` folder of the project's build directory.

## Customizing
Building Garden Linux is based on a [feature system](features/README.md).

| Feature Type | Includes |
|---|---|
| Platforms | ali, aws, azure, gcp, ... |
| Features | container host, vitual host, ... |
| Modifiers |Â _slim. _readonly, _pxe ... |
| Element | cis, fedramp |

if you want to build manually choose:
```
build.sh  --features <Platform>,[<feature1>],[<featureX>],[_modifier1],[_modifierX] destination [version]
```
**Example:**
```
build.sh  --features server,cloud,cis,vmware .build/
```
This builds a server image, cloud-like, with `CIS`feature for the VMware platform. The build result can be found in `.build/`. Also look into our [Version scheme](VERSION.md) since adding a date or a Version targets the whole build for a specific date.

## Deploying
Deploying on common cloud platforms requires additional packages. The following overview gives a short quick start to run cloud platform deployments. Currently, all modules are based on `Python`. Therefore, please make sure to have Python installed.

| Platform | Module  |
|---|---|
| Alicloud | [Aliyun CLI](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-cli)
| AWS: | [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
| Azure | [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-apt)
| GCP: | [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=Unpaidsocial&utm_campaign=car-20200311-Quickstart-Mac#linux), [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install?hl=de#install)
| OpenStack | [OpenStackCLI](https://github.com/openstack/python-openstackclient)

## Release
Garden Linux frequently publishes snapshot releases. These are available as machine images in most major cloud providers as well as file-system images for manual import. See the [releases](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/releases) page for more info.

## Documentation
Garden Linux provides a great documentation for build options, customizing, configuration, tests and pipeline integrations. The documentation can be found within the project's `docs/` path or by clicking <a href="https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/tree/main/docs">here</a>. Next to this, Garden Linux can build in an automated way for continous integration. See [ci/README.md](ci/README.md) for details.

<i>Feel free to add further documentation or to adjust already existing one. Please take care about our style guide. More information are available in in <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> and our `docs/`.</i>
