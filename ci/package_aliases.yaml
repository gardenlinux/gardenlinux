# This file contains a mapping of debian-package-names to a list of package-name aliases.
# When we create a component descriptor for the gardenlinux-artefacts as part of the build process, this mapping
# is consulted when creating the labels that provide additional information about the build's contents.
# Ultimately, these labels are then used to be able to determine a package-version if our automated scanner isn't
# able to by itself because the package name it knows differs from the debian-package-name.
