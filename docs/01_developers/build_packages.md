Garden Linux packages are built using [the `package-build` scripts](https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-build).

Each package has it's own GitHub repository following the naming convention `package-{package_name}`.
Those packages are picked up by [the workflows of the 'repo'](https://github.com/gardenlinux/repo).

As a trivial example, have a look at [`gardenlinux/package-containerd`](https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-containerd).

As a non-trivial example have a look at [`gardenlinux/package-openssh`](https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-openssh).
