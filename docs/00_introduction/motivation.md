# Motivation Behind Garden Linux

Garden Linux was conceived with a vision to address the evolving needs of modern infrastructure. It's not just about creating another Linux distribution; it's about crafting an OS that's adaptable, efficient, and secure. 

## Core Concepts

### **Efficient Build System**
- **Builder (Meta Package Manager)**: Instead of reinventing the wheel, Garden Linux continues to work with existing package managers. What's innovative is how we use them, leading to the creation of the builder. It's about reimagining the usage, not the tool itself.
  
### **Optimized Repository**
- **Repo**: Garden Linux maintains an apt repository where Debian packages are adapted, kept up-to-date, and streamlined. The focus is on systemd, ensuring no unnecessary complexities.

### **Container-Centric Design**
- **Container**: Garden Linux is not just an OS for machines but also a container OS. It ensures containers can be executed seamlessly. On the flip side, it also provides a base layer for containers, making it a dual-purpose OS.

The journey of Garden Linux began with recognizing the gaps in existing solutions. While many distributions catered to general needs, there was a niche for an OS that could be tailored, right from its kernel to its features, for specific use cases. Garden Linux fills this niche, offering modularity that's unparalleled. Whether it's for a large-scale cloud deployment or a specialized hardware setup, Garden Linux provides the tools and flexibility to create an OS that's just right.
