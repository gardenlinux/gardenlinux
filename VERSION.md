# Versioning

Garden Linux is versioned by the day of the created binary release (image):

The Release 1 would have been when the project was created on March 31st 2020.
Since there was much more coding to be done the first stable release was 27 ->
created on April 27th 2020.

Release day (as in Date) - April 1st 2020 (+1) = version number

     27.04.2020 - 01.04.2020 + 1 = 27
     01.06.2020 - 01.04.2020 + 1 = 62

All this calculation is done in `bin/garden-version`.
