A word of **WARNING**: Since OpenStack is an open environment, we can only provide a reference implementation at this point.
This particular feature set for Garden Linux on OpenStack is for an OpenStack landscape with bare-metal hardware (which is why it builds on top of the `metal` feature).

If you want to run Garden Linux on OpenStack, you will most likely have to create your own feature set that matches your environment and/or hypervisor.
