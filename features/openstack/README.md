## OpenStack Feature

OpenStack platform (cloud-init, open-vm-tools)

	Type: platform
	Included Features: cloud

#

A word of **WARNING**: Since OpenStack is an open environment, we can only provide a reference implementation at this point.
This particular feature set for Garden Linux on OpenStack is for an OpenStack landscape that uses VMware ESXi as hypervisor (which is why you will find `open-vm-tools` in `pkg.include`).

If you want to run Garden Linux on OpenStack, you will most likely have to create your own feature set that matches your environment and hypervisor.
